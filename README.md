Hello there, No-Conflicts Team is on the line!
We're honoured to introduce you to our recent project - Nice Gadgets Store!

Small, simple and usable website for online tech shopping written on React.
Our platform doesn't only look smart, but also provides most of the required functionalities and covers different use cases.

Let's dive into more details.

## Project's Goal & Requirements

Our project aimed to test our knowledge in creating usable React applications using up-to-date functionality.
However, we believe, that the main part of this was practicing our communication skills.

**Project's Requirements**
- *Implement a responsive website, which consists of the following pages: Home, Cart, Favourites, Catalog, Product page, and Not Found page.*
- *Fetch & prepare data from the server to display it on a website.*
- *Implement Cart & Favourites functionality (save data to localStorage)*

 ## Key features

- **Dynamic sliders**: Slider components can be changed dynamically by parsing different props for headlines & images.
- **Smooth animations & loaders**: To improve UI, we added small cute animations and loaders.
- **Lazy loading**: Each page imports as a lazy one to improve download speed.
- **Responsive design. Mobile first**: Our website is designed to be displayed optimally both on mobiles and desktops
- **Dark\Light Theme**: To save users' eyes, we added the dark mode to our website.
- **Local Storage**: Your cart or favourite items are saved even if you leave them without making a checkout! Don't worry!
- **Catalog Search & filtering**: Looking for smth more specific? Ok! Just use the search bar written on useSearchParams, so you'll be able to share that link with your friend!
- **Optimization**: Say no to extra component rerenderings!
- **Smart Recommendations and BrandNewItems!**: Our recommendations shows you only relevant products!
- **Notifications**: if something goes wrong, you'll quickly find the core of the issue with small notifications!

## Future features

- Firebase authorization & order database: we're working on adding an authorization system to our project so you won't lose track of your order. It has been already partially implemented.

## Used Technologies
- **React**: The core of our project
- **TypeScript**: Our security card for safety development
- **Vite**: for building our project
- **SASS**: easy styling!
- **Prettier**: just some sprinkles to make our code readable.
- **Swiper**: for implementing dynamic sliders on the Homepage and Product page.
- **React-paginate**: for implementing simple pagination
- **React-swipeable**: for implementing Gallery swipeable cards.
- **Firebase**: for user authorization
- **Netlify**: for automatic project deployment

**!!! We didn't use Redux due to the simplicity of the project. 'Work smart, not hard' as they say.**
