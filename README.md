# HEY THERE NO_CONFLICTS MEMBERS

Ander [Anna] is here!
I've just set our project up, so I'd like to give you a small recap of its contents

## What's inside?

Currently, the list of dependencies is kind of small, but we might add more plugins and libs in the future, so don't forget to check the README.md regularly for updates.

You **HAVE TO** review and install:

- _Swiper_
- _React paginate_
- _Sass_

_Though, you can simply run `npm install` and all necessary dependencies will be installed._

### DO NOT FORGET TO CREATE YOUR OWN BRANCHES!

I'd really appreciate if we could name our branches by the same template, for example: `[username]-develop-[page]`.

**For now, have a nice rest before tomorrows code hell!**
